#  Write a Python program to check if the given number is Happy Number.

'''
 Happy Number: A Happy Number is a positive integer that, when you repeatedly replace
 the number by the sum of the squares of its digits and continue the process, eventually
 reaches 1. If the process never reaches 1 but instead loops endlessly in a cycle, the number
 is not a Happy Number.
  For example:
 19 is a Happy Number because:
 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 =1
 The process reaches 1, so 19 is a Happy Number.
